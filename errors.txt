--FIXED--
ERROR #1 refactoring the code that adds Event Listeners to the buttons into a function,
so it can be called when starting a game and afer activating hard-mode to add the Listeners
to the two additional buttons caused an inexplicable error where you could not get the
answer correct on hard mode, and after reseting after a loss in normal mode

instead of putting the addEventListeners to game buttons code into a function, so I can
call it in two seperate places makin my code D.R.Y., I will reuse the code until a solution
is found
